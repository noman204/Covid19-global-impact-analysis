#  Global COVID-19 Impact Analysis: Mortality Trends, Regional Comparisons & Vaccination Insights

# Project Overview:

This project delivers a comprehensive and data-driven exploration of the global COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing mortality trends, regional disparities, and vaccination rollout dynamics. Leveraging authoritative data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Our World in Data, the analysis uncovers key epidemiological patterns and informs public health strategies.

# Key Deliverables & Analytical Insights:

# ðŸ”¹ Temporal Mortality Trends

â€¢	Modeled daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million across leading nations.
â€¢	Identified and visualized pandemic wave patterns using advanced time-series analysis.
â€¢	Assessed the effectiveness of containment measures and vaccination on reducing mortality.

# ðŸ”¹ Global and Regional Mortality Distribution

â€¢	Segmented cumulative COVID-19 deaths by continents and regions.
â€¢	Highlighted disproportionate mortality impacts in Europe, North America, and South America.
â€¢	Explored factors contributing to lower mortality rates in Africa and Oceania through contextual data overlays.

# ðŸ”¹ Vaccination Progress Assessment

â€¢	Tracked and compared vaccination coverage globally by country and region.
â€¢	Visualized first-dose vs. full vaccination rates using proportional and trend-based plots.
â€¢	Identified rollout bottlenecks and regional disparities in vaccine accessibility and uptake.


# ðŸ”¹ Statistical & Epidemiological Analysis

â€¢	Performed correlation analysis between vaccination rates and mortality decline.
â€¢	Conducted hypothesis testing to validate the significance of regional variation in death rates.
â€¢	Applied regression models to forecast short-term mortality based on vaccination metrics and public health interventions.

# ðŸ”¹ Data Engineering & Processing

â€¢	Extracted and transformed large-scale datasets using SQL and Excel-based data pipelines.
â€¢	Designed modular and reproducible workflows for public health data analysis.
â€¢	Ensured data integrity and clarity through rigorous preprocessing, aggregation, and normalization.
â€¢	SQL Proficiency: Writing complex queries for data cleaning, aggregation, and analytical computations. Statistical Analysis: Deriving meaningful insights from raw data to calculate key performance indicators like death rates and infection percentages.
â€¢	Data Visualization (Implied by the 'Results' tables): Presenting analytical outcomes in a clear and organized manner.
